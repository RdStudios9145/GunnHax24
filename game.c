  All of the guests were there for dinner at the same time, and we \
  finished at around 10 pm. Me, the poet, the merchant, and the old \
  man went back to the living room, the butler gave us some drinks \
  from upstairs and cleaned some rooms, and I don't know where \
  everyone else went after that.",
  // The Merchant's dialogue
  "Dinner started at 8:30 pm soon after I arrived. The cook served \
  us dinner and we finished at 10 pm. I went back to the living room \
  with the host and some of the other guests. After an hour or so, \
  the host went upstairs and came back with some drinks while the \
  butler went to clean some rooms. Soon before the butler discovered \
  the body, the professor excused himself to use the bathroom.",
  // The Cook's dialogue
  "I started preparing the meal two hours before the guests arrived \
  at 8:30. I served courses for dinner for an hour and a half and \
  cleaned dishes throughout dinner and after until 10:30 pm. I served \
  some snacks for the guests afterward, and the host asked for a knife \
  for the snacks. One of the guests returned it to me at around 11 pm \
  as I was cleaning dishes from the snacks.",

  "Oh my son, my son! Whyyyyy? I was downstairs the whole time, during\
   and after dinner, just talking with the butler near the stairs. I\
    should have never come here with my son! Why would the colonel\
     invite me to his party anyway? He hates me!",
